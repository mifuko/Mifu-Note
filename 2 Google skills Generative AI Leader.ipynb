    "\n",
    "**Correct answer:**  \n",
    "- **Foundation models offer a vast knowledge base, and prompt engineering guides the model to use this knowledge in responses.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Foundation models are trained on large and diverse datasets, giving them broad knowledge and general capabilities. Prompt engineering does not retrain the model; instead, it shapes how the model applies its existing knowledge. By carefully designing prompts, users can guide the model to produce more relevant, accurate, and useful outputs for specific tasks or contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Which of the following defines a foundation model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct answer:**  \n",
    "- **Large AI models trained on a vast quantity of data, capable of adapting to a variety of tasks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Foundation models are characterized by their scale and generality. They are trained on massive, diverse datasets and can be adapted to many different downstream tasks, rather than being limited to a single, narrowly defined function.\n",

    "### 3. Which of the following is a primary feature of foundation models?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correct answer:**  \n",
    "- **Adaptability across a wide range of tasks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "A key feature of foundation models is their ability to be reused and adapted for many tasks, such as text generation, summarization, translation, or image understanding, without requiring training a completely new model from scratch.\n",

    "- **To provide input to the model and trigger an output.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "A prompt is the input given to a foundation model that tells it what to do. Prompts do not train or fine-tune the model; instead, they guide the model at inference time to generate a specific type of response based on the user’s intent.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. What is the primary way that agents learn in reinforcement learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Correct answer:**  \n",
    "**By interacting with their environment and receiving feedback.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "In reinforcement learning, an agent learns through **trial and error**. It takes actions within an environment and receives feedback in the form of **rewards or penalties**. Over time, the agent learns which actions maximize cumulative reward. Unlike supervised learning, there are no labeled examples telling the agent the “correct” action in advance.\n",

    "\n",
    "✅ **Correct answer:**  \n",
    "**Data ingestion and preparation → Model training → Model deployment → Model management**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "The machine learning lifecycle follows a logical flow:\n",
    "1. **Data ingestion and preparation** – Collect and clean data.\n",
    "2. **Model training** – Use prepared data to train the model.\n",
    "3. **Model deployment** – Make the trained model available for predictions.\n",
    "4. **Model management** – Monitor, version, and maintain the model over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is the primary purpose of the data ingestion and preparation stage in the ML workflow?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Correct answer:**  \n",
    "**Collecting, cleaning, and transforming raw data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "This stage ensures that raw, scattered data is converted into a **consistent, high-quality, and usable format**. Proper data preparation is critical, as poor-quality data can severely reduce model performance regardless of how advanced the algorithm is.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. How does consistency impact AI model training?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Correct answer:**  \n",
    "**Inconsistent formats and labeling can confuse the model and hinder learning.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Consistency in data formats, units, and labels helps the model correctly identify patterns. Inconsistent data can introduce noise, slow convergence, and reduce accuracy, making it harder for the model to learn meaningful relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Which of the following is an example of unstructured data?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Correct answer:**  \n",
    "**A collection of customer reviews in the form of free-text paragraphs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Unstructured data does not follow a predefined schema or format. Free-text reviews, images, videos, and audio files are common examples. In contrast, tables, spreadsheets, and databases with fixed columns are structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. What is a \"model\" in the context of machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Correct answer:**  \n",
    "**A complex mathematical structure that processes inputs to generate outputs.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "A machine learning model represents learned patterns in data using mathematical functions. It takes input data, applies learned parameters, and produces predictions or decisions. It is not hardware, visualization, or a fixed rule-based system.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the ML lifecycle, data quality, and learning approaches is essential for building effective AI systems. High-quality data, correct workflows, and appropriate learning methods directly determine model success.\n"
